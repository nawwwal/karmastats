description: Performance optimization guidelines for KARMASTAT statistical calculators, covering bundle size management, animation efficiency, and calculation optimization. This rule addresses Core Web Vitals targets including First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint metrics, bundle optimization strategies with lazy loading for large datasets and conditional mobile component loading, animation performance using CSS transforms and hardware acceleration, calculation efficiency with debounced real-time calculations and Web Worker implementation for complex statistical operations, memory management practices for event listeners and chart instances, and critical monitoring for infinite loops in statistical functions and bundle size growth tracking.

# KARMASTAT — Performance Standards

## Core Web Vitals Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Touch Response**: < 100ms
- **Animation Frame Rate**: ≥ 60fps

## Bundle Optimization
```typescript
// Lazy load large datasets
const foodDatabase = lazy(() => import('./data/food-database.json'));

// Conditional mobile loading
const MobileComponent = isMobile ?
  lazy(() => import('./mobile/Component')) : null;
```

## Animation Performance
- Use CSS transforms over layout changes
- Prefer `requestAnimationFrame` for custom animations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Hardware acceleration: `transform3d(0,0,0)` or `will-change`

## Calculation Efficiency
- Debounce real-time calculations (300ms minimum)
- Cache expensive mathematical operations
- Use Web Workers for complex statistical calculations
- Implement convergence safety in iterative algorithms

## Memory Management
- Clean up event listeners in `useEffect` cleanup
- Dispose of chart instances properly
- Limit large arrays in state (>1000 items)
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations only

## Critical Monitoring
- Watch for infinite loops in `statistics.ts` betacf function
- Monitor bundle size growth (target: <500KB gzipped)
- Track calculation completion times
- Measure mobile touch responsiveness
